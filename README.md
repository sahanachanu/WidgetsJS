# WidgetsJS
This repository contains widgets which are built using JavaScript
These widgets are most commonly used.
The reason behind buiding this was to make the code reusable whenever such widgets are needed in webpages. 
It reduces time by preventing re-writig of code each time.
The widget code is well commented so the user of the widget finds it easy to implement.
Few more widgets will be updated to this repository very soon.
